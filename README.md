Task 1:
- A Function 'processArray' takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where even numbers are squared and odd numbers are tripled.

Task 2:
- A function 'formatArrayStrings' takes two arrays: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by 'processArray'.
- It modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd.

Task 3:
